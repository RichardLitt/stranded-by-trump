## For Travelers & Refugees

Here’s what to know if you are denied entry to the United States:

  * Know your rights at the airport, and when detained (American Civil Liberties Union).
  * DO NOT SIGN anything you are asked to sign, including and especially Form I-407.
  * Do not voluntarily abandon your green card or lawful permanent resident application.
  * → Instead, ask for a lawyer.
    * Lawyers in JFK did an [AMA on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5qyc5v/we_are_the_lawyers_volunteering_at_jfk_we_need/) about how they are helping refugees with legal advice
  * Find housing:
    * Americans are offering sanctuary to those in need.

## About this site

Stranded By Trump was made by a group of Americans (mostly) traveling in Buenos Aires who felt dispirited and dejected by the news coming out of the U.S. Rather than sit around and feel powerless, we decided to build a site to help, however we could - some friends on Twitter helped out, too.

We are nominally non-partisan, but we acknowledge that Trump's executive orders were racist, xenophobic, alienating, and decidedly un-American. We believe that no one person is illegal, and that America is best when it is welcoming all.

If you'd like to help out, please contact us at [strandedbytrump@gmail.com](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

<h2 class="final-thought">It seems overwhelming, but we can overcome.</h2>
<p class="final-thought">
  By taking action together, we will save lives, keep families together, and show the world that Trump does not speak for all Americans.
