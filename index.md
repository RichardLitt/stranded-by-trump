# For Travelers & Refugees

Here’s what to know if you are denied entry to the United States:

**1. Know your rights at the airport**, and when detained. <a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights" target="_blank">Read more</a> at the American Civil Liberties Union website.

**2. DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING** you are asked to sign, including and especially Form I-407, even if they say it will make life easier.

**3. Do not voluntarily abandon your green card** or lawful permanent resident application.

**4. Demand a hearing with a judge.** You have the right to an immigration judge. 

**5. Ask for a lawyer.** If you are detained at an airport in the United States, you can also request legal assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union by contacting their [local representative](https://www.aclu.org/about/affiliates?redirect=affiliates). You have the right to an attorney. Only discuss your details with the attorney, not with the CPB.

**6. Reach out!**

The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/academics/clinics/immigration/clear.html">CUNY Clear Project</a> has a Free Legal Hotline and is encouraging all passport holders from the targeted countries to call.
The phone number is: +1 718-348-4558. Email: <a href="mailto:cunyclear@email.law.cuny.edu" target="_blank">cunyclear@email.law.cuny.edu</a>

# Contribute

We need help! Currently, there are a few things you can do to help @StrandedByTrump have more impact:
- **Share on Social Media**;
- **Translate**: We need translations in **Arabic**, **Kurdish**, **Farsi**, Balochi, Azerbaijani, Berber, **Somali**, Zigua, Italian, **Kurmanji**, Armenian, and French. If you speak any of these, get in touch. For Arabic, if you speak a regional dialect or can translate, also get in touch. [Use this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQFET4wn_JPxjFJ2UIlF0ALaqvOecgKd2t1C5bufPzvRveRA/viewform).
- **Help source data**: We're working on two things: a list of US Representatives stances on the Ban, and a list of resources for who is in the airports right now. Tweet at us or email!
- **Code**: We need to get i18n running for the translators. Can you help? Also, look at [the issues here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/stranded-by-trump).

# About this site

Stranded By Trump was made by a group of Americans (mostly) traveling in Buenos Aires who felt dispirited and dejected by the news coming out of the U.S. Rather than sit around and feel powerless, we and some friends from Twitter decided to build a site to help.

We are nominally non-partisan, but we acknowledge that Trump's executive orders were racist, xenophobic, alienating, and decidedly un-American. We believe that no one person is illegal, and that America is best when it is welcoming all.

Site idea and planning by <a href="https://twitter.com/richlitt" target="_blank">@richlitt</a>. The logo is by <a href="http://www.waldbach.nl/" target="_blank">Janne Wolterbeek</a> helped out.

If you'd like to help out, please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">strandedbytrump@gmail.com</a>.

<h2 class="final-thought">We're in this together. #resist</h2>
<p class="final-thought">
  By taking action together, we will save lives, keep families together, and show the world that Trump does not speak for all Americans.
