# About this site

Stranded By Trump was made by a group of Americans (mostly) traveling in Buenos Aires who felt dispirited and dejected by the news coming out of the U.S. Rather than sit around and feel powerless, we and some friends from Twitter decided to build a site to help.

We are nominally non-partisan, but we acknowledge that Trump's executive orders were racist, xenophobic, alienating, and decidedly un-American. We believe that no one person is illegal, and that America is best when it is welcoming all.

Site idea and planning by <a href="http://www.waldbach.nl/" target="_blank">. Others (anonymous" target="_blank">@richlitt](https://twitter.com/richlitt). The logo is by [Janne Wolterbeek</a> helped out.

If you'd like to help out, please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">strandedbytrump@gmail.com</a>.

<h2 class="final-thought">We're in this together. #resist</h2>
<p class="final-thought">
  By taking action together, we will save lives, keep families together, and show the world that Trump does not speak for all Americans.
